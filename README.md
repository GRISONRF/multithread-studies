# Repository to implement threads in a Java application.

Implementing threads in an application can provide several benefits, such as:

-Improved performance<br>
-Responsiveness<br>
-Resource Utilization<br>
-Simplified Coding<br>
-Scalability<br>

So I decided to create a very simple program to better understand how threads work, how they can be synchronized, and how they can interact with each other.

I will update this repository with a more descriptive READ ME when the application is done.
